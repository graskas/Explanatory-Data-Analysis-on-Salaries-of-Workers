# Explanatory-Data-Analysis-on-Salaries-of-Workers

This project looks at how some metrics of Salaries of workers such as Age, Years of Experience, Job Title, Gender determines the Salary of a worker.


- The data was cleaned to remove the missing values by dropping the values rows that had no value in these columns with the help of the pandas dropna().

Some of the libraries used were **numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**.

- The work was then concluded with a data visualisation of some of the variables to make inferences out of the data  and the inferences made were as as follows;

1. There is a positive relationship between Age of a worker and the Salary the worker earns. That is, as the Age of the worker increases, the salary the worker earns increases as well.
2. There is a postive relationship between Years of Experience and Salary of worker. So as the years the worker keeps working increases, the salary of the worker increases as well.
