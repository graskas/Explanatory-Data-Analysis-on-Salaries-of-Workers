# Explanatory-Data-Analysis-on-Salaries-of-Workers

This project looks at how some metrics of Salaries of workers such as Age, Years of Experience, Job Title, Gender determines the Salary of a worker.

The data was found on kaggle and then cleaned to remove some missing values and which was needed for further analysis.
The work was then concluded with a data visualisation of some of the variables to make inferences out of the data.

Some of the libraries used were **numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**.

**Some inferences from the analysis are as follows:**

1. There is a positive relationship between Age of a worker and the Salary the worker earns. That is, as the Age of the worker increases, the salary the worker earns increases as well.
2. There is a postive relationship between Years of Experience and Salary of worker. So as the years the worker keeps working increases, the salary of the worker increases as well.
